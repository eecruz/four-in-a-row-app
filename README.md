# SER210 Four in a Row App

## What is this?
This is an android application created for Quinnipiac's SER210 Android Development class.


## Rules and Gameplay
The game follows the traditional rules of tic-tac-toe, except players are aiming for four in a row/column/diagonal to win as opposed to three. 

Users will play against a computer, each taking turns making moves on a 6x6 matrix. 

The computer will try to block player wins going either horizontally or vertically.
